# Time-Series-Analysis
Time Series Project - Building a SARIMA model to predict the forecast of passengers in China X'AN North Railway Station.
Time Series analysis was done in MINITAB.
Procedures - Time series plot analysis, decomposition, differencing, making the the time series stationary, Checking ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF(Partial Autocorrelation function)
Deterimine values of paramaters of the SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s. Diagnostic checking and selecting the best model with higher accuracy.
